# Smart Mobile Robots - Robo Monitor IoT

Develop a monitoring system that records temperature and
humidity by saving them to a CSV file. In case of disconnection from the Wi-Fi network, the
data is recorded locally and, when the connection is reestablished, it is
sent to a MongoDB database via an API developed in Python.
The application must also allow data queries via requests using
Swagger.
